###The tidy data set
The tidy data set is a data set modified from the original data files located at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The original data files are explained in the README.md file.

###Description of the Raw data set

The collection process for the data is explained in the README file from the zip file above. The important information from that file
is located below:

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

###Description of the tidy data set

The raw data contains 561 features. The tidy data set selects only the features described by the assignment. Specifically all 
features which contain mean and standard deviation (std) in their feature description. Therefore the tidy data set
only contains 88 variables (the first column (header) in the tidy.txt file). The raw data contained (test+train) a total of 10299 observables. The tidy data set is the mean of the 88 variables by participant and the activity. The result is 180 observables.

So the tidy data is the mean for each mean/std feature for each participant and their associated activity of the combined test/train data.
